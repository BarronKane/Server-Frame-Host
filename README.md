# What is this?

Server Frame Host is an server application admin interface for use in infrastructure
or other remote use cases. If you're running a game
server (i.e. Factorio), you could go into the webserver where this is hosted and
apply commands and logic to your application to manipulate it, start/stop it,
access logs or system resources, etc.

This has potential enterprise use as well as I plan to add in distributed
command structures for multiple remote applications.

This is an early work in progess for my own needs, but anyone is welcome to
contribute and use the software.
